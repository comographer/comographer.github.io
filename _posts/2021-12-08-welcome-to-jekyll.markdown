This blog will be about my `coding/programming` learning journey.
Earlier this summer, I have tried learing to code and that lasted about a good three months.
Now I'm trying to get back to it and hopefully this time I will keep it going.

So stick around if you are interested in what I will be studying.

All my previous works can be found in [my github repository](https://github.com/comogarpher).
