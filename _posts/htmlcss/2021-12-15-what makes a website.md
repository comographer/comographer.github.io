A website is just a bunch of **TEXT**.  
Browser are designed to understand those texts and show us all the text, images, and interactivities.

Usually, websites are made of 2 or 3 languages.

> HTML, CSS and Javascript.

If we compare a website to human body, **HTML** is the bone,  
**CSS** is the muscle and skin and **Javascript** is the brain.  
Let's look into it in more detail.

## HTML

HTML is a markup language.  
It explains to the browser how our contents are structured.  
Whether a line of text is title, header, navigation, etc.

## CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  
It basically puts make up on HTML, in other words, design.

HTML on its own is very ugly since it is only black texts on white background.

What HTML is telling the browser is simply:

> "Okay, this is an image."  
> "And this is a paragraph."

This is basically it.

If we use CSS, it will tell the browser:

> "That image should be in the center and size is 25px 100px."  
> "Paragraph should have background color of green."

Without HTML, CSS has nothing to design and without CSS, HTML will look very ugly.

## Javascript

Javascript makes the website smart.  
It gives interactivity to the website, the ability to do complex things, etc.

Among these three languages, Javascript is the only _Programming Language_.
