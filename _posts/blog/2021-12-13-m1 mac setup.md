This post explains my initial setup on M1 Macbook Air(2020) for development.
<br>
It's my first time using Macbook so some essential steps might be missing.

# Development Setup

Here are some things that I find to be essential setups for development.
<br>
I didn't include any programing language installation as I will do those along the way when I need them.

## Homebrew

Intall via Terminal

```
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Add brew to PATH to enable commands

```
$ echo 'export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Not sure if this is necessary

```
$ source ~/.zshrc
```

To check if installation has been done correctly and if command works

```
$ brew --version
```

## Visual Studio Code

```
$ brew install visual-studio-code
```

## Rosetta2

```
$ /usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

## Git

```
$ brew install git
```

## Java

Tap from Homebrew

```
$ brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
```

Look for available versions

```
$ brew search openjdk
```

Install version 14

```
$ brew install adoptopenjdk14
```

## Iterm2

```
$ brew install --cask iterm2
```

## Ohmyzsh

```
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Powerlevel10k

```
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
$ Set ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k" in ~/.zshrc
```

## Google Chrome

```
$ brew install google-chrome
```

## Github CLI

```
$ brew install gh
$ gh auth login
$ git config --global user.name "your name"
$ git config --global user.email "your email"
```
