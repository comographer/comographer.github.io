# Welcome!

This blog will be about my `coding/programming` learning journey.
Earlier this summer, I have tried learing to code and that lasted about a good three months.
Now I'm trying to get back to it and hopefully this time I can keep it going.

So stick around if you are interested in what I will be studying.

All my previous works can be found in **[my github repository](https://github.com/comogarpher)**.

Below is just testing image for Markdown image link.

And yes, I am a huge **`WoW`** fan

## Test Code

Below is test sample code to check kramdown

```python
class <className>:

    <class_attribute_name> = <value>

    def __init__(self,<param1>, <param2>, ...):
        self.<attr1> = <param1>
        self.<attr2> = <param2>
        .
        .
        .
        # As many attributes as needed

   def <method_name>(self, <param1>, ...):
       <code>

   # As many methods as needed
```
